# Guard::Sprockets [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/guard/guard-sprockets.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/guard/guard-sprockets)

Sprockets guard automatically packages your JavaScript files together when your source files are saved.

* Compatible with Sprockets 2.x (for Sprockets 1.x compatibility, please use Guard::Sprockets 0.1.4 or the `sprockets_1` branch).
* Tested against Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, REE and the latest versions of JRuby & Rubinius.

## Install
